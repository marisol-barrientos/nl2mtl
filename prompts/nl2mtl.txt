Prompt for Translating Natural Language Text to Metric Temporal Logic (MTL)

Objective: Translate a given natural language text into Metric Temporal Logic (MTL).

Background: Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) is a formalization tool that incorporates time-bound statements using atomic propositions,
Boolean operators, and temporal operators. Key temporal operators include G (globally), X (next), F (eventually), O (once), and S (since),
which can be used with specific time intervals [lb, ub]. Additionally, Boolean operators ¬ (not), ∧ (and), ∨ (or),
and the implication operator a =⇒ b (defined as ¬a ∨ b) are essential components.

Text to be Formalized: [NATURAL_LANGUAGE_TEXT_HERE]

Translation Process:
1. Decompose the provided statement into individual atomic propositions.
2. Identify temporal relationships within the statement.
3. Construct MTL expressions using the appropriate temporal and Boolean operators, as outlined above.

Expected Output: A JSON file representing the MTL translation, adhering to a snake_case naming convention.

JSON Structure:
1. "context": Describes the scenario's context.
2. "MTL_expressions": An array of elements, each containing:
   - "id"
   - "description"
   - "propositions": Each proposition includes:
       - "id"
       - "description"
       - "assumptions": Assumptions made during MTL_expression construction.
       - "ambiguities": Unclear or vague aspects, or those lacking context.
       - "granularity": Temporal granularity of the proposition (e.g., seconds).
   - "MTL_expression": The constructed MTL expression incorporating all propositions.
3. "dependency_sequence": An array detailing the dependency among expressions, including:
   - "preceding_id": ID of the preceding MTL expression.
   - "following_id": ID of the following MTL expression.
   - "dependency_description": Description of the dependency.
4. "non_formalized_parts": Elements for parts of the text not formalized, including:
   - "id"
   - "description": Original text part not formalized.
   - "reason_for_non_formalization": Explanation for the inability to formalize.

Instruction: Generate the JSON file methodically, ensuring each MTL_expression is included without omission.
