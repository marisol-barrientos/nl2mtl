# NL2MTL - Automatic Extraction and Formalization of Temporal Requirements from Text: A Survey

## 1. Implementation:
All the scripts which allow the extraction of MTL formulas are inside [src folder](src/). To enable their execution, one should add local configuration to this [file](config.json).

## 2. Results:
Inside [data folder](data/), there are the input files used in the evaluation together with their corresponding outputs. The sheet containing the qualitative evaluation is [inside this file](survey_material/eval/eval_re_2024.ods).

## 3. Survey Material:

### Bibliography Sheet:
Information about all included studies can be found [in this sheet](survey_material/re_2024_automatic_extraction_and_formalization_of_temporal_requirements_fromt_text_a_survey.xlsx).


### Open Source Data:
The open source data from selected papers from the category of Automatic Generation of Formal Specifications is available [here](survey_material/datasets). The following table shows from which studies was coming which dataset, together with an input and output example.
