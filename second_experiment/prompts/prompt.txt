Translate Natural Language to Metric Temporal Logic (MTL)

We know that Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) allows for the formalization of time-bound statements using atomic propositions, Boolean operators, and temporal operators. Highlight the use of temporal operators G (globally), X (next), F (eventually), O (once), and S (since) with specified time intervals [lb, ub]. Also, mention the Boolean operators ¬ (not), ∧ (and), ∨ (or), and the implication a =⇒ b (defined as ¬a ∨ b).

Text to be Formalized: "HERE_INPUT_TEXT"

The output should be a JSON file representing the MTL translation, with the following naming conventions:
- Use snake_case for key names.

The JSON structure should include:
1. "scenario_title": A representative title for the given input.
2. "context": An indication of the scenario's context.
3. "MTL_expressions": An array where each element contains:
   3.1. "id"
   3.2. "description"
   3.3. "MTL_fitness_details": Contains three variables:
       - "explanation": Evaluates if MTL is the proper format to formalize this description.
       - "MTL_fitness": A score ("High," "Medium," or "Low").
       - "alternative_methods": Suggests other formalization formats that could fit better.
   3.4. "propositions": An array containing all propositions. Each proposition contains the following variables:
       - "id"
       - "description"
       - "assumptions"
       - "ambiguities": Indicates if any part of the text was unclear, vague, or lacked context.
       - "priority": Can be "High," "Medium," or "Low," depending on its relevance in the overall scenario.
       - "granularity": Indicates the temporal granularity of the proposition (e.g., seconds).
   3.5. "MTL_expression": The built MTL expression containing all propositions.
4. "non_formalized_parts": An array where each element contains:
   - "id"
   - "description": Original part of text not formalized.
   - "reason_for_non_formalization": The reason why it was not possible to formalize it.
5. "sequence_dependencies": An array where each element contains:
   - "preceding_id": The ID of the preceding MTL expression.
   - "following_id": The ID of the following MTL expressions.
   - "dependency_description": A description of the dependency.
6. "conflicts": An array where each element contains:
   - "id"
   - "description": Explanation of the conflict.
   - "ids_involved_mtl_expressions": A set of IDs of the MTL expressions that generate conflicts between each other.

Please, generate the JSON file step by step, do not miss any MTL_expression.
