Translate a Natural Language Text to Metric Temporal Logic (MTL)

We know that Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) allows for the formalization of time-bound statements using atomic propositions,
Boolean operators, and temporal operators. Highlight the use of temporal operators G (globally), X (next), F (eventually), O (once), and S (since) with specified time intervals [lb, ub]. Also, mention the Boolean operators ¬ (not), ∧ (and), ∨ (or), and the implication a =⇒ b (defined as ¬a ∨ b).

Text to be Formalized: "HERE_INPUT_TEXT"

Please remember to 1. Decompose the statement into individual atomic propositions. 2. Identify the temporal relationships present in the statement.
3. Formulate these relationships into MTL (Metric Temporal Logic) expressions using appropriate temporal and Boolean operators, as described avobe.

The output should be a JSON file representing the MTL translation, with the following snake_case naming convention.

The JSON structure should include:
1. "context": Indicate the scenario's context.
2. "MTL_expressions": An array where each element contains:
   2.1. "id"
   2.2. "description"
   2.3. "propositions": Each proposition contains the following variables:
       - "id"
       - "description"
       - "assumptions": Indicates assumptions made while constructing the MTL_expression.
       - "ambiguities": Indicates if any part of the text was unclear, vague, or lacked context.
       - "granularity": Indicates the temporal granularity of the proposition (e.g., seconds).
   2.4. "MTL_expression": The built MTL expression containing all propositions.
2. "dependency_sequence": An array where each element contains:
   - "preceding_id": The ID of the preceding MTL expression.
   - "following_id": The ID of the following MTL expressions.
   - "dependency_description": A description of the dependency.
3. "non_formalized_parts": An array where each element contains:
   - "id"
   - "description": Original part of text not formalized.
   - "reason_for_non_formalization": The reason why it was not possible to formalize it.


Please, generate the JSON file step by step, do not miss any MTL_expression.
