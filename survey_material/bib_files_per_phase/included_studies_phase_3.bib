abstract="The present study aims at filling the gap between the existing traffic regulation and the technical specification for construction or behavior in operation of autonomous vehicles. The former is provided in generic and often complicated texts as the lawyers tend to cover with a single formulation all possible cases, including those not yet identified. On the contrary, for the latter, the engineers need to identify any possible situation in advance and produce precise instructions to assess, approach and deal with it, to be embedded in the safety and security logic of the self-driving vehicle.",
