FINAL PROMPT:
Translate the following natural langauge sentence into an STL formula and explain your translation step by step. Let a and b be variables. Remember that U[a,b] means
"until the interval a and b", "F [a,b]" means eventually in the interval between a and b, and always is "G[a,b]". Additionally, STL consists of predicates.
Assume signals x1[t], x2[t], . . . , xn[t], then atomic predicates are of the form:
f(x1[t], . . . , xn[t]) > 0. The STL formula should only contain atomic propositions, boolean operators &, ~, ->, <-> and temporal operators U[a,b], G[a,b], F[a,b].
Natural Language: The signal is never above 3.5. Given translations: {}
Explanation: "The signal" from the input translates to the variable "x[t]", "above 3.5"
from the input translates to "> 3.5", "never above 3.5" thus means that the signal
should never be above 3.5, i.e., always under 3.5. Explanation dictionary:
{"The signal": "x[t]", "above 3.5": "> 3.5", "never above 3.5": "G < 3.5"}
FINAL: G (x[t] < 3.5).
Natural Langauge: Between 2s and 6s the signal is between -2 and 2. Given translations: {} Explanation: "Between 2s and 6s" from the input translates to the
temporal operator "G[2,6]" and "the signal is between -2 and 2" translates to the predicate "|x[t]| < 2". Explanation dictionary: {"Between 2s and 6s": "G[2,6]",
"the signal is between -2 and 2": "|x[t]| < 2"}.
FINAL: G[2,6] (|x[t]| < 2).
Natural Language: Whenever the transition action that the value of signal r S n n 4 G B S u b goes out of the bound (2044, 2391) occurs, and the l J a H E 9 g Y signal remains larger than 5.7, then in response after a time in the subsequent 46 time units, the value of signal U _ d T x 6 shall be in the interval [2, 4] and then always remains like this for every moment in the following 8 time units.

Given translations: {}
Explanation:
OUTPUT
"Whenever the transition action that the value of signal r S n n 4 G B S u b goes out of the bound (2044, 2391) occurs" translates to "rSnn4GBSub[t] < 2044 | rSnn4GBSub[t] > 2391". "and the l J a H E 9 g Y signal remains larger than 5.7" translates to "lJaHE9gY[t] > 5.7". "then in response after a time in the subsequent 46 time units, the value of signal U _ d T x 6 shall be in the interval [2, 4]" translates to "F[0,46] (2 <= UdTx6[t] <= 4)". "and then always remains like this for every moment in the following 8 time units" translates to "G[0,8] (2 <= UdTx6[t] <= 4)". 

Explanation dictionary: {"Whenever the transition action that the value of signal r S n n 4 G B S u b goes out of the bound (2044, 2391) occurs": "rSnn4GBSub[t] < 2044 | rSnn4GBSub[t] > 2391", "and the l J a H E 9 g Y signal remains larger than 5.7": "lJaHE9gY[t] > 5.7", "then in response after a time in the subsequent 46 time units, the value of signal U _ d T x 6 shall be in the interval [2, 4]": "F[0,46] (2 <= UdTx6[t] <= 4)", "and then always remains like this for every moment in the following 8 time units": "G[0,8] (2 <= UdTx6[t] <= 4)"}

FINAL: (rSnn4GBSub[t] < 2044 | rSnn4GBSub[t] > 2391) & lJaHE9gY[t] > 5.7 -> F[0,46] (2 <= UdTx6[t] <= 4) & G[0,8] (2 <= UdTx6[t] <= 4).
