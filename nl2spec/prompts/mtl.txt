Translate the following natural language sentence into an MTL formula and explain your translation step by step:
Natural Language:
"Within the first hour, the system must not fail. However, it should eventually undergo maintenance between the 2nd and 4th hour, after which the system should operate flawlessly for at least 3 hours."
Explanation:
    "The system must not fail within the first hour."
        Explanation: "Within the first hour" translates to the temporal operator G_[0,1]. "The system must not fail" translates to a condition like not system_fail.
        Explanation dictionary: {"Within the first hour": "G_[0,1]", "The system must not fail": "not system_fail"}.

    "The system should eventually undergo maintenance between the 2nd and 4th hour."
        Explanation: "Eventually between the 2nd and 4th hour" translates to F_[2,4]. "Undergo maintenance" translates to a condition like maintenance.
        Explanation dictionary: {"Eventually between the 2nd and 4th hour": "F_[2,4]", "Undergo maintenance": "maintenance"}.

    "After maintenance, the system should operate flawlessly for at least 3 hours."
        Explanation: "After maintenance" implies a conditional relationship, leading to the use of ->. "Operate flawlessly for at least 3 hours" translates to G_[0,3] (flawless_operation).
        Explanation dictionary: {"After maintenance": "->", "Operate flawlessly for at least 3 hours": "G_[0,3] (flawless_operation)"}.

FINAL:
G_[0,1] (not system_fail) & F_[2,4] (maintenance) & (maintenance -> G_[0,3] (flawless_operation))
In this MTL formula, each part of the sentence is translated into a logical and temporal expression, capturing the sequence and timing of events (system not failing, undergoing maintenance, and operating flawlessly) in a precise and formal way.
