Globally, if consecutively j I J f 3 has been staying at least 1 and less than or equal to 9 since the value of signal h P l o X N r 1 C was once no larger than 1277, which was observed at a certain time point within the past 5.3 time units then the following condition will not be true: there will be ultimately a certain moment in the next 5 time units, at which the Z _ u 1 6 l 8 I p X signal is bigger than 5.62 and smaller than 9.57.


OUTPUT
This sentence is quite complex and requires breaking down into several parts. 

"Globally" translates to the temporal operator "G". 

"if consecutively j I J f 3 has been staying at least 1 and less than or equal to 9 since the value of signal h P l o X N r 1 C was once no larger than 1277, which was observed at a certain time point within the past 5.3 time units" translates to the predicate "(j I J f 3[t] >= 1 & j I J f 3[t] <= 9) U[-5.3,0] (h P l o X N r 1 C[t] <= 1277)". 

"then the following condition will not be true: there will be ultimately a certain moment in the next 5 time units, at which the Z _ u 1 6 l 8 I p X signal is bigger than 5.62 and smaller than 9.57" translates to the predicate "~F[0,5] (Z _ u 1 6 l 8 I p X[t] > 5.62 & Z _ u 1 6 l 8 I p X[t] < 9.57)". 

Putting it all together, we get the following STL formula:

G ((j I J f 3[t] >= 1 & j I J f 3[t] <= 9) U[-5.3,0] (h P l o X N r 1 C[t] <= 1277) -> ~F[0,5] (Z _ u 1 6 l 8 I p X[t] > 5.62 & Z _ u 1 6 l 8 I p X[t] < 9.57)).
