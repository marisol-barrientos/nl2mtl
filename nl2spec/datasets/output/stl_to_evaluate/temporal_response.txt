FINAL PROMPT:
Translate the following natural langauge sentence into an STL formula and explain your translation step by step. Let a and b be variables. Remember that U[a,b] means
"until the interval a and b", "F [a,b]" means eventually in the interval between a and b, and always is "G[a,b]". Additionally, STL consists of predicates.
Assume signals x1[t], x2[t], . . . , xn[t], then atomic predicates are of the form:
f(x1[t], . . . , xn[t]) > 0. The STL formula should only contain atomic propositions, boolean operators &, ~, ->, <-> and temporal operators U[a,b], G[a,b], F[a,b].
Natural Language: The signal is never above 3.5. Given translations: {}
Explanation: "The signal" from the input translates to the variable "x[t]", "above 3.5"
from the input translates to "> 3.5", "never above 3.5" thus means that the signal
should never be above 3.5, i.e., always under 3.5. Explanation dictionary:
{"The signal": "x[t]", "above 3.5": "> 3.5", "never above 3.5": "G < 3.5"}
FINAL: G (x[t] < 3.5).
Natural Langauge: Between 2s and 6s the signal is between -2 and 2. Given translations: {} Explanation: "Between 2s and 6s" from the input translates to the
temporal operator "G[2,6]" and "the signal is between -2 and 2" translates to the predicate "|x[t]| < 2". Explanation dictionary: {"Between 2s and 6s": "G[2,6]",
"the signal is between -2 and 2": "|x[t]| < 2"}.
FINAL: G[2,6] (|x[t]| < 2).
Natural Language: Globally, if consecutively j I J f 3 has been staying at least 1 and less than or equal to 9 since the value of signal h P l o X N r 1 C was once no larger than 1277, which was observed at a certain time point within the past 5.3 time units then the following condition will not be true: there will be ultimately a certain moment in the next 5 time units, at which the Z _ u 1 6 l 8 I p X signal is bigger than 5.62 and smaller than 9.57.
Given translations: {}
Explanation:
OUTPUT
This sentence is quite complex and requires breaking down into several parts. 

"Globally" translates to the temporal operator "G". 

"if consecutively j I J f 3 has been staying at least 1 and less than or equal to 9 since the value of signal h P l o X N r 1 C was once no larger than 1277, which was observed at a certain time point within the past 5.3 time units" translates to the predicate "(j I J f 3[t] >= 1 & j I J f 3[t] <= 9) U[-5.3,0] (h P l o X N r 1 C[t] <= 1277)". 

"then the following condition will not be true: there will be ultimately a certain moment in the next 5 time units, at which the Z _ u 1 6 l 8 I p X signal is bigger than 5.62 and smaller than 9.57" translates to the predicate "~F[0,5] (Z _ u 1 6 l 8 I p X[t] > 5.62 & Z _ u 1 6 l 8 I p X[t] < 9.57)". 

Putting it all together, we get the following STL formula:

G ((j I J f 3[t] >= 1 & j I J f 3[t] <= 9) U[-5.3,0] (h P l o X N r 1 C[t] <= 1277) -> ~F[0,5] (Z _ u 1 6 l 8 I p X[t] > 5.62 & Z _ u 1 6 l 8 I p X[t] < 9.57)).

Explanation dictionary: {"Globally": "G", "if consecutively j I J f 3 has been staying at least 1 and less than or equal to 9 since the value of signal h P l o X N r 1 C was once no larger than 1277, which was observed at a certain time point within the past 5.3 time units": "(j I J f 3[t] >= 1 & j I J f 3[t] <= 9) U[-5.3,0] (h P l o X N r 1 C[t] <= 1277)", "then the following condition will not be true: there will be ultimately a certain moment in the next 5 time units, at which the Z _ u 1 6 l 8 I p X signal is bigger than 5.62 and smaller than 9.57": "~F[0,5] (Z _ u 1 6 l 8 I p X[t] > 5.62 & Z _ u 1 6 l 8 I p X[t] < 9.57)"}.

FINAL: G ((j I J f 3[t] >= 1 & j I J f 3[t] <= 9) U[-5.3,0] (h P l o X N r 1 C[t] <= 1277) -> ~F[0,5] (Z _ u 1 6 l 8 I p X[t] > 5.62 & Z _ u 1 6 l 8 I p X[t] < 9.57)).
